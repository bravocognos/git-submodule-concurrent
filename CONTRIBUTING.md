## Pull Requests

I'm very picky about the code that goes into this repo. So if you violate any of the following guidelines, there is a good chance I won't merge your pull request.

- There must be a strong case for your additions/changes, such as:
  - Bug fixes.
  - Approved feature request.
  - Improvements in stability.
  - Improvements in performance.
  - Improvements in readability.
  - Addition of tests.
- **Your code must follow the structure and convention of the existing code (80 cols, vertical spacing, code grouping, naming, documentation, branch naming, etc.). Consistency is everything.** 
- All functions/types/variables/constants, even private ones, must have comments in good English (please include punctuation). These comments must be elaborate enough so that new users understand them, and can follow them. Provide examples if you have to.
- Your changes must not decrease the project's quality rating.
- No breaking changes.
